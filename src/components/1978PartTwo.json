Dr. Vladimir Zoukhar was a known psycho-neurologist and director of the Central Laboratory for Psychology in Moscow’s School of Medicine. His expertise had been sought ever since the 1974 Candidates Final where Korchnoi had bragged that his mind games forced Karpov to seek therapy. Karpov repeatedly insisted that Zoukhar was not an official member of the Soviet Delegation and thereby free to do as he pleased.",

    "text": "“The Soviets want to kill him in a mental way” Leeuwerik had said of Korchnoi. The Challenger’s delegation had begun to develop the theory that Dr. Zoukhar was hypnotizing Korchnoi from a distance through his noticeable habit of staring fixedly at the Challenger from the front left row during much of the contest until now. Seemingly every shortcoming of Korchnoi’s was now attributed to the work of this mysterious hypnotist. Naturally, Karpov would repeatedly boast of his ability to overcome these forces.",
