    “Dear colleagues! World Champion Anatoly Karpov has asked me, as press
    attaché of the Soviet delegation, to bring the following to the notice of
    the representatives of the press. Over a number of years Korchnoi has made
    insulting remarks about Karpov, other grandmasters, and well-known chess
    officials. Nevertheless, following the principles of sportsmanship and to
    meet the wishes of the esteemed organizers of such a significant event as a
    match for the World Championship, the World Champion was prepared to shake
    hands with his opponent before the start of each game. And he did this even
    after, at his pre-match press conference in Manila, Korchnoi once again took
    the liberty of insulting the World Champion and a number of members of his
    delegation. Recent events have shown that the Challenger has no intention of
    rejecting his course of aggravating the situation. Under such circumstances
    Karpov does not wish to shake hands with Korchnoi.”
