 “Dear colleagues! World Champion Anatoly Karpov has asked me, as press attaché of the Soviet delegation, to bring the following to the notice of the representatives of the press. 
Over a number of years Korchnoi has made insulting remarks about Karpov, other grandmasters, and well-known chess officials. Nevertheless, following the principles of sportsmanship and to meet the wishes of the esteemed organizers of such a significant event as a match for the World Championship, the World Champion was prepared to shake hands with his opponent before the start of each game. And he did this even after, at his pre-match press conference in Manila, Korchnoi once again took the liberty of insulting the World Champion and a number of members of his delegation. 
Recent events have shown that the Challenger has no intention of rejecting his course of aggravating the situation. Under such circumstances Karpov does not wish to shake hands with Korchnoi.”

Introduction
The contrast between the 1974 Candidate’s Final and the 1978 World Chess Championship could not be higher. Game 2 of the 1974 match in Moscow has come to be regarded as a modern classic in tactics, strategy, and chess brilliance between two of the game’s best. The absurdist theatre witnessed throughout the entire 1978 Championship instantly earned its reputation as a notorious example of the type of superstition, paranoia and scandal commonly observed in chess lore throughout the game’s rich history. However, there are a few key similarities that will emerge as the focus of this paper that also carry broad implications for the way we extract meaning from information. The visualizations that accompany the game analysis are designed to help readers see chess in the same way that a grandmaster can, and in so doing, help them to identify certain patterns between a grandmaster’s state of mind and their own. 

I will argue that in many ways, a grandmasters’ heightened sensitivity to pattern recognition can be a blessing and a curse. In 1974, we can observe that the quality of the games were the result of each player’s singular ability to perceive threats on the board and respond to them. Meanwhile, the Championship in the Philippines is characterized by each player’s preoccupation with threats, real or imagined, off of the board, and we should not be surprised to learn that few people today study these games to gain a better understanding of how to play chess. This is no better illustrated than by Karpov’s own written account of the 1978 match, “From Baguio to Moreno.” You could easily forget that the story is told from the winner’s perspective while reading each grievance-filled page so concerned with perceived slights, settling of scores and foiled sub-plots, that the few instances of any game analysis read like footnotes. Is this sudden obsession with what is happening beyond the game due to boredom? Is this a natural progression once you have reached chess at this level? This paper will not attempt to answer that question but will attempt to both qualify and quantify the relationship between chess, pattern recognition and the pitfalls therein with supporting documentation from other historical accounts and written works on chess theory, statistics and cognitive psychology. 
Among the documentation supporting this hypothesis will be a probabilistic study on the veracity of what may very well count as one of the least offensive conspiracies put forth in the last 30 years by Bobby Fischer, when the budding Holocaust denier claimed that all of the games in the 1985 WCC were rigged. The only evidence provided by Fischer to support this claim was a sequence of 18 consecutive moves observed in the fourth game between Karpov and Kasparov, all of which happened to land on black-colored squares. From this, we will see further evidence that the relationship between the ability to see patterns and a proclivity for conspiracy theory is not limited to the unique dynamic between Karpov and Korchnoi, or any single set of circumstances in 1978. Chess trains you to be always one step ahead of every scheme, sub-plot, feint, decoy, and other deceit. While the key is to focus this energy on the 64 squares located within the boundaries of the chessboard, Segal shows us how easy it is for this attention to wander beyond the limits of both the chessboard and math. 
We will also see a number of studies that analyze the effects of time pressure on chess skill and expert-level decision-making. Chess skill is widely understood to be split between fast pattern recognition processes and slow search processes. The hypothesis here being that when the time required to think 10-15 moves ahead is curtailed, pattern recognition remains the decisive factor in the outcome. While The Effects of Time Pressure on Chess Skill remains inconclusive about the precise role of pattern recognition in a fast-paced environment, the author’s analysis does reveal that the strength of the relationship between chess skill and time increases as the length of the game decreases. This suggests that fast processes do play an outsized role in some way. Other studies show still-clearer evidence of the relationship between time and pattern recognition. In Response Time Distributions in Rapid Chess, researchers analyze the response times of each move in rapid chess games using highly precise data only made available in recent years through online chess platforms. They also make an important note about chess played in its ideal form as a “state function,” absent of any true codependencies, and where choosing each move is based solely on the current board position. The crucial point here being that humans are largely incapable of this kind of play, “rather, the existence of plans and schemes, the influence of previous thoughts and evaluations, the assessment of the opponent ability in deciding whether to gamble on a risky move, and in particular, the presence of a time constrain, are likely to be reflected in an interaction between successive moves.” 
The question here of whether or not grandmaster level chess players rely on a high sensitivity to pattern recognition, and in what ways this can act for or against them, will be tested first with a reconstruction of the 1978 match. This analysis will consist almost entirely of qualitative data which will include photos, diagrams and textual data to try and accurately depict the often-unquantifiable nature of this particular chess match.
Following this, we will travel back to Game 2 of the 1974 Candidates match, which is divided naturally into three parts - the opening, middle game, and end game - in order to compare and contrast these two matches. This will feature Anatoly Karpov’s annotations of each board position throughout, in addition to my own analysis and quantitative research to support the conclusion that there is a strong relationship between chess skill and pattern recognition that can be decisive when leveraged well, and counterproductive when this type of mental energy lacks focus. 
As a final note, it is my responsibility to point out that the intention here is not to diagnose all grandmaster-level chess players as somehow “paranoid” or “crazy” by nature. Rather, the attempt is made to identify the type of skillset required to navigate a specific kind of high-pressure environment, and to draw parallels between the ways that both the subjects of my research and the reading public manage this. The hope is that doing this may help shed light on the ways in which we interpret data in today’s condensed, unrelenting, 280-character media landscape, where we are often expected to digest information reduced to the size of a mobile phone under extreme time pressure. Are we under the same kind of pressure as a chess genius? Is this reasonable? What ways do chess prodigies respond to this pressure and what are the possible outcomes?
We begin our analysis by pointing out the most obvious link between these two very different events; a matchup between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi. In the 4 years between the two matches, Korchnoi has defected to Switzerland, and Karpov has, by default, been crowned World Champion after Bobby Fischer took issue with the rather conventional terms of the 1975 Championship match, and left chess for good. The veteran Korchnoi has won the opportunity to redeem himself against the young prodigy, and the long history between these two has reached a crescendo by 1978. 
 “Trifles, Which Cannot Be Ignored”
Bagiuo, 1978
Typhoon Emang arrived in the Phillipines on the first day of game 5. Karpov described the sound of the rain as sufficient to drown out the noise of an already tempestuous affair inside the brand new Baguio City Convention Center.* Up until this point, the loudest protest had come from the precise meaning of the violet colored yogurt being delivered to Karpov during each game. “It is clear that a cunningly arranged distribution of edible items to one player during the game, emenating from one delegation or the other, could convey a kind of coded message,” read the official complaint to the Chief Arbiter. “Thus, a yogurt after move 20 could signify ‘we instruct you to offer a draw’; or a sliced mango could mean ‘we order you to decline a draw’.  A dish of marinated quails’ eggs could mean ‘play Ng4 at once’, and so on. The possibilities are limitless,” it continued. But this had, by game 5, become a tightly choreographed ritual, and the colorful yogurt arrived by waiter at 7:15pm sharp, without exception. There were of course, other squabbles over which flag Korchnoi should be allowed to play under, for instance, or Karpov’s endless suspicion towards the decisions of the event organizers on everything from the location of the tournament, to the make and model of the chess clocks. Additionally, Korchnoi’s predictable refusal to stand for the Soviet National Anthem during the opening ceremony was rendered moot when the orchestra mistakenly played the Internationale instead. However, it wasn’t until game 5 that things took a dark turn.
There was a growing awareness of Dr. Vladimir Zoukhar’s presence in the room that appeared to arrive with the weather. The storm had knocked out the power and a dim emergency lamp was all that lit the main stage for a time. The opponents played fast. In the middle of this, Petra Leeuwerik, Head of the Korchnoi Delegation, reportedly rose from her party’s designated seating area in the back and, against regulation, quietly advanced towards the front spectator rows. She sat next to Dr. Zoukhar and handed him a copy of “The Gulag Archipelago.” This was not a gift. 
Petra had spent nine years in the notorious Vorkuta labor camp for spying in Soviet Vienna after World War II. Dr. Vladimir Zoukhar was a known psycho-neurologist and director of the Central Laboratory for Psychology in Moscow’s School of Medicine. His expertise had been sought ever since the 1974 Candidates Final where Korchnoi bragged that his mind games forced Karpov to seek therapy. Karpov repeatedly insisted that Zoukhar was not an official member of the Soviet Delegation and thereby free to do as he pleased. “The Soviets want to kill him in a mental way” Leeuwerik had said of Korchnoi. The Challenger’s delegation had begun to develop the theory that Dr. Zoukhar was hypnotizing Korchnoi from a distance through his noticeable habit of staring fixedly at the Challenger from the front left row during much of the contest until now. Seemingly every shortcoming of Korchnoi’s was now attributed to the work of this mysterious hypnotist. Naturally, Karpov would repeatedly boast of his ability to overcome these forces. The press ate it up. Leeuwerik accused Dr. Zoukhar of being a parapsychological hooligan and demanded that no official, or unofficial members of either camp be allowed in the front row. The Chief Organizer obliged and this sideshow began to compete for attention with the game as this melodrama unfolded. Dr. Zoukhar’s seating position began to be recorded with diligence by all those concerned. The first row on the left during games 2, 3, 4 and 5. The right side of row 2 in game 6 and 7. On the left side of the 5th row in game 8 and the right side in game 9. Games 10 and 11 have him on the right side again, but back two ranks on the 7th. One begins to imagine the orthagonal movements of a Bishop. 
A volley of official complaints and counter-complaints over the seating positions of hypnotists would plague the rest of the match. Game 12 saw the intrduction of Korchnoi’s own parapsychologist, Dr. Vladimir M. Berginer, who, in addition to an army of local students of a parapsychology guru named Fathre Bulatao, had been recruited to counter Dr. Zoukhar’s psychic energy. He took a seat in the fourth row to the left, where he would remain until game 14, when Karpov took a decisive lead after a two-game streak. The post game celebration was interrupted by 3 earthquakes, with Typhoon Miding due to arrive in time for game 15.  
Typhoons, earthquakes, floods and at least one deadly landslide menaced the immediate area throughout the event but, given the especially disastrous turn of events since his arrival, Dr. Berginer’s effectiveness as a parapsychologist had quickly come into question by the Korchnoi delegation. “Viktor is now convinced that neither Zoukhar nor Berginer can have any effect upon a player during a game,” Leeuwerik announced before Korchnoi’s game 14 loss. Dr. Berginer left the Phillipines shortly after this.
There is always a certain amount of psychological warfare that takes place during a chess game. For example, the ongoing fuss over Korchnoi’s mirror-tinted glasses (known at the time as “the device”) was the result of a passive aggressive attempt to thwart Karpov’s own tactic of staring directly into the eyes of his opponent. A compelling argument could also be made that Korchnoi’s accusations against Dr. Zoukhar merely came from an attempt to explain away his own blunders, rather than a deeply held belief in telekenesis. However, there is, in fact, plenty of evidence that points to a familiarity with paranoia, superstition and pseudo-science between the two, which may or may not always track with a number of contradictory statements made by either one. The answer appears to be somewhere in between belief and suspicion, as it were. 
Karpov may not demonstrate a remarkable interest in the field of parapsychology beyond a token impulse to avoid being outgunned on this or any other front, but his paranoia is evident through his continued suspicion towards the maneuvers of not only the Korchnoi delegation, but the allegedly neutral organizing committee itself.  As it happens, the scrutiny that Karpov   placed on the bidding process for the host city was not entirely unwarranted, but the length to which he goes to account for every potential scheme, characterize motivations, and assess the implications for his position in virtually every other stage of the event is remarkable.
Likewise, we see Korchnoi waffle on his faith in parapsychology at various times throughout the tournament, while the Executive Director of the U.S. Chess Federation describes Korchnoi’s “fascination” with parapsychology spanning many years. Much has been written about Viktor Korchnoi’s regimine that we may also draw from. He laced his morning oatmeal with whiskey and plugged himself into a heating battery at night to treat his hypochondria, believeing his condition was in part due to excess static electricity., After the Dr. Berginer debacle, Korchnoi enlisted the help of two particularly militant members of the Ananda Marga religious sect, who were currently out on bail in the Phillipines for the attempted murder of an Indian diplomat.  “Dada” and “Didi”, as they became known, had been given a mandate to teach Korchnoi concentration techniques using yoga and other methods for the remainder of the match. His devotion the teachings of Didi and Dada would color the rest of the match.
By game 32, both players’ nerves are shot. Chess at this level is hard enough without having to endure a veritable arms race of parapsychologists, muderous Ananda Marga yogis and Soviet operatives doing everything they can to subvert your efforts amidst a biblical onslaught of natural disasters. Karpov had missed a number of opportunities to win the match outright going as far back as game 8, and watched as his 5-1 lead dwindled to 5-5 by the final game. “The tiresome weather with its constant rain and wind had suddenly begun to irritate me,” he stated.  The Ananda Marga contingent had maintained a presence “casting spells” in the lotus position until game 20, when the organizers disallowed the attendance of “persons of known criminal records.”  The Ananda Margas multiplied, terrifying various officials with threatening messages while Didi and Dada continued to hold clandestine yoga classes from Korchnoi’s FIDE-sponsored hotel room. The Korchnoi delegation would become so overwhelmed with offers of “support” from members of this feared religous cult that they petitioned the appeal jury for protection.The irony was lost on no one. The breach of an agreement reached a month earlier regarding the presece of any and all hypnotists also brought Dr. Zoukhar back to the fourth row for the final game. The conclusion of the longest final in the tournament’s history would arrive in a somewhat anticlimactic fashion. The biggest controversy came from Korchnoi’s refusal to officially concede, preferring instead to simply decline a return to the board after the game had been ajdourned for the day. Korchnoi was not seen again for the remainder of the event’s conclusion.
Discussion
Many things stand out about this match, but time was clearly an important factor, first and foremost. Spanning almost 100 days, the individual games were themselves, often split into multi-day fragments.  Was this “hurry-up-and-wait” a factor in the way each player enetrtained various paranoias and conspiracies in Baguio? How exactly does time effect what each player sees or doesn’t see? Neither player exhibited much brilliance when given such an extended demonstration of their abilities. So what was the differentiator? We will go back 4 years to game 2 of their Candidate’s Final in Moscow to help shed some light on these questions."
