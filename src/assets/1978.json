    "text": "Typhoon Emang struck the Philippines on the first day of game five. Karpov described the sound of the rain as sufficient to drown out the noise of an already tempestuous affair inside the brand new Baguio City Convention Center. Up until this point, the loudest protest came from that of the precise meaning behind the violet colored yogurt being delivered to Karpov during each game.",

    "text": "“It is clear that a cunningly arranged distribution of edible items to one player during the game, emanating from one delegation or the other, could convey a kind of coded message,” read the official complaint to the Chief Arbiter. “Thus, a yogurt after move 20 could signify ‘we instruct you to offer a draw’; or a sliced mango could mean ‘we order you to decline a draw’.  A dish of marinated quails’ eggs could mean ‘play Ng4 at once’, and so on. The possibilities are limitless,” it continued.",

There were of course, other squabbles over which flag Korchnoi should be allowed to play under, for instance, or Karpov’s endless suspicion towards the decisions of the event organizers on everything from the location of the tournament, to the make and model of the chess clocks. He even had Korchnoi's designer chair x-rayed for signalling devices at one point. However, spectators were spared the drama of Korchnoi’s predictable refusal to stand for the Soviet National Anthem during the opening ceremony when the orchestra mistakenly played the Internationale instead. But it wasn’t until game five that things took a dark turn.",

    "text": "There was a growing awareness of Dr. Vladimir Zoukhar’s presence in the room that appeared to arrive with the weather. The storm had knocked out the power and a dim emergency lamp was all that lit the main stage for a time. The opponents played fast. In the middle of this, Petra Leeuwerik, Head of the Korchnoi Delegation, reportedly rose from her party’s designated seating area in the back and, against regulation, quietly advanced towards the front spectator rows. She sat next to Dr. Zoukhar and handed him a copy of “The Gulag Archipelago.” This was not a gift.",
