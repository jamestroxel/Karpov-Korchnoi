# Karpov | Korchnoi
## Visualizing Chess, Patterns and Paranoia

### Abstract
This project analyzes two remarkabley different chess matches played between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi: the game two classic from the 1974 Candidates Final in Moscow, and the entire, bizarre 1978 World Chess Championship in the Philippines. The research qualifies and quantifies the relationship between chess, pattern recognition, and the pitfalls therein with supporting documentation from other historical accounts and written works on chess theory, statistics, and cognitive psychology. Additionally, we will see that a grandmaster's heightened sensitivity to pattern recognition, time and ulterior motives carry broad implications for the way we extract meaning from information in our own high-pressure environment today. The visualizations that accompany the game analysis are designed to help readers see chess in the same way that a grandmaster does, and in so doing, help them to identify similarities between a grandmaster’s state of mind and their own. Are we under the same kind of pressure as a chess genius? Is this reasonable? What ways do chess prodigies respond to this pressure and what are the possible outcomes?
